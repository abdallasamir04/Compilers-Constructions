The **Scanner and Process Stages** project is a part of the **Compilers Constructions Project** course.  
This project simulates the development of a **compiler's lexical analysis** stage, focusing on **scanner functionality**. It processes and validates **identifiers** while checking if they are reserved words, and sets the foundation for future compiler stages.  
Developed by **_Abdalla Mahmoud Samir_** as part of the **Compilers Constructions Project** course at **Assiut National University**.

## üöÄ Features

### Scanner Functionality
- Scans and validates **identifiers** entered by the user.
- Checks if the identifiers are **reserved words** or **valid user-defined identifiers**.
- Prompts users to continue entering identifiers until they choose to exit.

### Reserved Word Check
- The system has a predefined set of **reserved words** and will flag them as invalid user-defined identifiers.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Identifier Validation
- The **scanner** checks each input to determine if it starts with a letter and is followed by letters or digits.

### Reserved Words Handling
- The **scanner** compares identifiers with a set of reserved words.
- Identifiers that match reserved words are flagged as invalid.

## üìú Commands

The following commands are part of the **scanner** system to handle user inputs:

| Command             | Description                               | Example                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `Enter identifier`   | Input an identifier for validation        | `Enter identifier: test1` |
| `y`                  | Continue to enter another identifier      | `Do you want to enter another identifier? (y/n): y` |
| `n`                  | Exit the program                          | `Do you want to enter another identifier? (y/n): n` |

## üíª Code Highlights

### Key Methods
| Method                        | Description                                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetIdentifier(string input)`  | Extracts and returns the identifier from user input.      |
| `IsReservedWord(string identifier)` | Checks if the identifier is part of reserved words.  |
| `IsLetter(char ch)`            | Checks if a character is a letter.                       |
| `IsLetterOrDigit(char ch)`     | Checks if a character is a letter or digit.              |
| `Main()`                       | The entry point of the program that starts the scanner.   |

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Reserved Words (HashSet)
- Stores all predefined **reserved words** to check for invalid identifiers.

### Scanner Logic
- **Input Handling:** Takes user input for identifiers.
- **Validation:** Checks if the input is a valid identifier and if it matches any reserved word.
- **User Interaction:** Continues prompting the user until they decide to stop.

---

## üìö Future Stages

### Lexical Analysis
- This project simulates the **lexical analysis** stage of a compiler.
- It involves **scanning** and **tokenizing** input, checking for valid identifiers, and flagging reserved words.

### Next Compiler Stages
- The project will evolve into the next stages of a compiler, including **syntax analysis**, **semantic analysis**, and other components.
